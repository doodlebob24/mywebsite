 This is what the Fortnite map looks like. You can land 
Anywhere, just beware of the storm. As the game goes 
On, the storm closes in. As the storm closes in, it does 
 more damage, so don't get caught in the storm!

        <h1>People Who Make Money Off of Gaming</h1>
        <p>People post videos on YouTube and if they get a lot of views, they get money off of those views.
        An Example of one of these people are Tyler Blevins, A.K.A Ninja. Tyler plays Fortnite mainly and streams on Twitch,
        which is also a platform where you post videos and get views. These views also make you money, but streaming is an
        effective way to make money and have fun. People can donate money to the streamer, they can follow that streamer,
        and they can subscribe to the streamer which costs money. This money benefits the streamer  for making more money.
        Tyler on the other hand, uses the money he gets to donate to charities. He also goes to events to play Fortnite,
        and the winner of these events get a large amount of money, which Tyler donates it all to charity if he wins.
        For example, Tyler and famous music-maker Marshmello won an event with prize money of $1 million.
        Every penny of this money was given to charity. Tyler has become so popular that he has over 19 million subscribers
        on YouTube and over 11 million followers on Twitch.
